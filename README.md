# About This Website

Welcome to my personal website, a space dedicated to showcasing my work in data visualization and analysis. Here, you'll find interactive dashboards and visualizations developed in **Tableau** and **Power BI**, as well as my reflections on key concepts and trends in data analytics.

This site also serves as a platform for a new and ambitious initiative: I will be creating and sharing weekly visualizations as part of the **Makeover Monday** challenge. This global community event inspires data enthusiasts to rethink and improve existing visualizations, helping me sharpen my skills and explore creative approaches to presenting data.

### What You Will Find Here

- **Weekly Tableau Visualizations:** Explore my ongoing series of Tableau visualizations, where I tackle a wide range of datasets and topics.
- **Project Visualizations:** Access detailed visualizations from my professional and personal projects, presented using **Tableau** and **Power BI**.
  
Stay tuned as I continue to expand this site with fresh content and insights every week.
